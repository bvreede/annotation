To run the annotation pipeline, two files are needed:
1. a csv input file, with the flybase ID in the first column, and the gene name/abbreviation in the second;
2. a (blastable) genome database.

The script is run as follows:
annotation.sh path/to/inputfile path/to/genome

That should do it!
